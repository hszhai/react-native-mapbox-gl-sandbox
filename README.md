# react-native-mapbox-gl-sandbox
A test of react-natove-mapbox-gl on Android

This basically followed the steps listed in android/install.md. When I run it, it gave me the error:
  /.../SandMapbox/index.android.js: Unexpected token(123:23)
  
Could you please tell me what might be the problem?

BTW, I did not commit node_modules; I include my token at mapbox for testing, which I will revoke after the problem is sovled.

Thank you!
